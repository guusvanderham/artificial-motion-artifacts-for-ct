Artificial Motion Artifacts For CT

Artificial motion artifacts for CT can be generated by simulating patient motion during simulated CT acquisition. As I show in my thesis, these artifacts can be used to train artifact detection networks.

CT acquisition is simulated using the [ASTRA-toolbox](https://www.astra-toolbox.com/) and patient motion is implemented by making use of [elastic deformation](https://github.com/gvtulder/elasticdeform). 

The environment for the creation of artifacts can be made using the anacona terminal:

````
conda create -n astra-env
conda activate astra-env
conda install -c astra-toolbox astra-toolbox
conda install pip
````

Then using pip the other requirements can be installed:
````
pip install matplotlib
pip install elasticdeform
pip install simpleitk
pip install scipy
pip install jupyter notebook
````

Then start the notebook using ````jupyter notebook```` and navigate to _artificial artifact creation.ipynb_.

Experiment with generating artifacts by changing the motion vector ````(dir_x, dir_y)```` or specify a different location for the patch. 

Lung masks can prevent certain mistakes in the generation of artifacts near the border of the lungs such as deformed ribs or unrealisic blurring. There are various methods to obtain lung masks such as the one by [Johannes Hofmanninger](https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask). When no lung mask is available supply the artifact generator with ````np.ones(patch_size)````.
